# Subset Generation Algorithm
## Description

This repository contains a set of MATLAB functions for working with subsets of a given set. Below are descriptions of each function

### 1. 'find_max_element_not_in_A(zbior, A)'

This function finds the maximum element in the set `zbior` that is not present in the subset `A`.
### 2. 'remove_elements_greater_than(A, a)'

This function removes elements greater than `a` from the subset `A`.
### 3. 'generate_subsets(zbior, A, num)'

This function generates subsets of the set `zbior` based on the provided parameters.
### 4. 'create_subset(zbior, A)'

This function creates a subset by adding the maximum element not in `A` to the existing subset.
Example Usage

matlab
```
% Example usage of the subset generation algorithm
% Define the set and subset A
set = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
A = [1, 2, 3, 5];

% Define the value of n (if you want all consecutive subsets, don't pass n to the function)
n = 10;

% Generate subsets using the provided function
subsets = generate_subsets(set, A, n);

% Display the generated subsets
for i = 1:length(subsets)
    disp(subsets{i});
end
```
