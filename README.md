# Subset Generation Algorithm
## Description

This algorithm is designed to generate all subsets of a given set. It utilizes several helper functions that perform various operations on the set. Here are their descriptions:
### 1. generate_subsets(set, A)

This function generates all subsets of the set, starting from subset A, and returns them as a cell array.
### 2. find_max_element_not_in_A(set, A)

This function finds the largest element in the set that is not part of subset A. It returns this element as the result.
### 3. subset(n, X)

The function creates a new subset by adding element n (if it is not -inf), removes elements greater than n, and returns the new subset along with the success status of the operation.
### 4. remove_elements_greater_than(A, a)

This function removes from subset A all elements greater than a, keeping only those that are less than or equal to a. The updated subset is returned as the result.
Example Usage

matlab

% Example usage of the subset generation algorithm
set = [1, 2, 3];
A = [];
results = generate_subsets(set, A);

disp("All subsets of the set:");
disp(results);

max_element = find_max_element_not_in_A(set, A);
disp("Largest element not in A:");
disp(max_element);

n = 2;
[X, success] = subset(n, A);
disp("New subset after adding element " + n + ":");
disp(X);
disp("Operation successful: " + success);

a = 2;
A = [1, 2, 3];
new_subset = remove_elements_greater_than(A, a);
disp("Updated subset after removing elements greater than " + a + ":");
disp(new_subset);
